# Algorithms and Design Patterns Website

Welcome to the Algorithms and Design Patterns website! This project serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various algorithms and design patterns used in software development.

## Overview

This website is structured to provide clear and concise information about different algorithms, particularly focusing on sorting algorithms, as well as key design patterns, with an emphasis on the Singleton pattern. Each section includes explanations, examples, and visualizations to enhance understanding.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
